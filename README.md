# iPDFGen

iPDFGen is a free, open-source .NET library designed to simplify PDF generation from Html by providing a unified API over multiple PDF generation providers. It allows seamless switching between providers (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright) without changing your code, addressing common challenges like licensing changes, page limits, or provider discontinuation.

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/marisvigulis/iPDFGen/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marisvigulis/iPDFGen/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

## Why iPDFGen?

- **Reliable and Flexible**: Supports multiple providers with a consistent API, making it easy to switch if a provider's terms or pricing change.
- **Open Source**: Freely available under the MIT License, with no commercial restrictions.
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized for typical workloads, with benchmarked performance across providers.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple setup and integration with .NET 8 applications.

## Quick Start

1. Install the core iPDFGen NuGet package:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.Core
   ```
2. Install a provider package (fastest and the most accurate is Playwright at the moment):
   ```bash
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.Playwright
   ```
3. Configure iPDFGen in your `Program.cs`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddPdfGen(options =>
   {
       options.UsePlaywright();
   });
   ```
4. Generate a PDF from HTML:
   ```csharp
   
   OneOf<PdfGenSuccessResult, PdfGenErrorResult> generatorResult = await app.Service
       .GetRequiredService<IPdfGenerator>()
       .Generate("<h1>Hello World!</h1>")
       
        Stream resultStream = result.Match(
            success => success.Stream,
            err => throw new Exception("Ups") // You might handle it differently upon a need
        );

        await WriteToFile(resultStream);
        
        
   async Task WriteToFile(Stream pdfStream)
   {
       await using var fileStream = File.OpenWrite("my.pdf");
       await pdfStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
   }
   ```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK or later

### Steps
1. Install the core iPDFGen package:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.Core
   ```
2. Choose a provider and install its package:
   ```bash
   # For Playwright
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.Playwright
   # For Puppeteer
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.Puppeteer
   # For Remote Server, before using this provider please refer to Remote server setup section
   dotnet add package iPDFGen.RemoteServer
   ```
3. Register iPDFGen in your `ServiceCollection`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddPdfGen(options =>
   {
       options
           .UsePlaywright() 
           // .UsePuppeteer() // For Puppeteer
           // .UseRemoteServer(new RemoteServerSettings
           // {
           //    BaseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
           //    CompressionType = CompressionType.None,
           //    SharedSecret = "Your shared secret"
           // }) // For remote server
           .SetMaxDegreeOfParallelism(16)
           .SetDefaultTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
   });
   ```
   During a first PDF File generation iPDFGen will **automagically** download needed assemblies.
4. Inject and use `IPdfGenerator` in your services (see Quick Start for an example).

## Supported Providers

| Package Name            | Underlying Provider      | Status            | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `iPDFGen.Puppeteer`     | Puppeteer-Sharp          | âœ… Supported       | Fast for single-page PDFs, requires Chromium.                         |
| `iPDFGen.Playwright`    | Microsoft Playwright     | âœ… Supported       | Best performance for multi-page PDFs, supports multiple browsers.     |
| `iPDFGen.RemoteServer`  | HttpClient               | âœ… Supported | Ideal for offloading PDF generation to a remote server.               |
| More providers          | TBD                      | ðŸš§ Planned        | Contributions welcome!                                                |

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks were conducted using a 2-page fake CV (`resume.A4.xs.html`) on a Linux Fedora 42 system with an
AMD Ryzen 9 7950X and .NET 8.0.16. The table below compares performance for generating one (`Single`) or eighty (`Eighty`) PDFs,
and single PDFs from URLs (`SingleByUrl`).

| Provider      | Method              | Mean       | Allocated   |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Puppeteer     | Single              |  13.824 ms |   766.55 KB |
| Playwright    | Single              |   6.586 ms |   385.35 KB |
| RemoteServer  | Single              |   7.118 ms |   204.77 KB |
| Puppeteer     | SingleByUrl         |  35.901 ms |   486.49 KB |
| Playwright    | SingleByUrl         |  12.030 ms |   330.33 KB |
| RemoteServer  | SingleByUrl         |  11.558 ms |    93.94 KB |
| Puppeteer     | Eighty              | 180.919 ms | 61352.66 KB |
| Playwright    | Eighty              |  79.948 ms | 31759.61 KB |
| RemoteServer  | Eighty              |  89.197 ms | 16394.76 KB |

**Key Observations**:
- Playwright outperforms Puppeteer in all scenarios, especially for bulk generation.
- Memory usage is significantly lower with Playwright for bulk tasks.
- The RemoteServer provider offers a good balance of performance and memory usage with just a minor overhead in a comparison to Playwright provider.
- Puppeteer's SingleByUrl method shows significantly higher latency compared to other methods.

## Remote server setup

Server is dockerized and pushed into Dockerhub [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/marisvigulis/ipdfgenserver/general)
Feel free to pull it and setup into any environment that supports Docker images.
Supports next Environment variables:

| Variable name                  | Default value               | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MAX_DEGREE_OF_PARALELLISM      | 16                          | How much parallel threads Server can handle, Recommendation to set to amount of vCores       |
| DEFAULT_TIMEOUT                | 30                          | Amount in seconds to wait for PDF generation before failing with timout                      |
| PDFGEN_PROVIDER                | Playwright                  | Provider to be used by PdfGen.Server to generate PDFs, Supported: Puppeteer/Playwright       |
| **SHARED_SECRET**              | **MAGIC_STRING_$2123499**   | **(!) Please always define that value to some unique string, don't rely on a Default value** |

Under the hood PdfGen.Server is running in HTTP mode, so it's your responsibility to delegate domain setup HTTPs inside your ingress/load-balancer.


## Troubleshooting

- **Browser not found**: Ensure Chromium (or another supported browser) is installed for Puppeteer/Playwright. Run `playwright install` for Playwright.
- **Timeout errors**: Increase the timeout using `SetDefaultTimeout` or check provider-specific issues.
- **Remote server errors**: Verify the server URL and shared secret for `UseRemoteServer`.
